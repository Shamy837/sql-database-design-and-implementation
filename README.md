Overview:
This project showcases the end-to-end design and implementation of a
normalized relational database for a second-hand bookstore, HandMeDown. 
The project covers conceptual modeling, logical design, normalization, 
and SQL implementation.

Problem Description:
A resale bookstore requires a structured data model to manage:
- A catalog of books (ISBN-based, not inventory-specific)
- Individual inventory items (new and used copies)
- Customers and staff
- Purchases and purchase history
- Reading groups organized by genre

Solution Approach:
The database was designed following standard relational database
design practices:
- Conceptual design using an ER diagram to identify entities,
   relationships, and attributes.
- Logical design derived from the conceptual model, including
   normalization to Third Normal Form.
- Definition of table schemas, primary keys, foreign keys, and
   functional dependencies.
- SQL implementation using MySQL.

Additional Information Included:
- Conceptual & Logical ERD 
- Logical Schema and Functional Dependencies 
- SQL schema creation code
- Sample data INSERT statements
- SQL view definition
- Example analytical queries
